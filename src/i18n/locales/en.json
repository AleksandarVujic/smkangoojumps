Massages only helped temporarily, but when I started training, my back stopped hurting and I no longer had problems with my shoulder blade. I literally used to cry from the pain, sometimes I’d stiffen up and the pain would spread to my lungs. During this training period, I’ve been more than satisfied. I adjusted my diet and really sweat a lot during training. The difference is obvious. I’m definitely not giving up, even after achieving results.",

      "q1": "What should I wear to my first Kangoo Jumps class?",
      "a1": "Wear comfortable athletic clothing that allows for movement. I'll provide the Kangoo Jumps shoes for your first class. Bring a water bottle and a towel. For regular participants, I recommend moisture-wicking fabrics and supportive athletic wear.",
      "q2": "Do I need any prior fitness experience?",
      "a2": "Absolutely not! Kangoo Jumps is suitable for all fitness levels. I offer beginner-friendly classes where you'll learn the basics at your own pace. The shoes do most of the work, making it easier on your joints than traditional exercise.",
      "q3": "How many calories can I burn in a class?",
      "a3": "You can burn between 300-600 calories per class, depending on the intensity level and your body weight. The unique bouncing motion increases caloric burn by up to 25% compared to traditional aerobics while feeling easier on your body.",
      "q4": "Is Kangoo Jumps safe for people with joint problems?",
      "a4": "Yes! Kangoo Jumps was originally developed for rehabilitation. The rebound shoes reduce impact on joints by up to 80%. However, I always recommend consulting with your doctor before starting any new exercise program, especially if you have existing health conditions.",
      "q5": "What if I have balance issues?",
      "a5": "The Kangoo Jump shoes actually help improve balance over time! I start beginners with basic movements and provide support throughout the class. The shoes have a low center of gravity that makes them surprisingly stable once you get used to them.",
      "q6": "How much do classes cost?",
      "a6": "I offer flexible pricing options including drop-in rates, class packages, and monthly memberships. Contact me for current pricing and special introductory offers for new clients. I also offer free consultations to help you choose the right program.",
      "q7": "What size shoes do you have available?",

      "q8": "Can I try a class before committing?",
